## Hackathon Friday 

**Some inspiration** 
> Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid of standing still. - *Chinese Proverb*

Bootcampers, look how far you’ve come! It’s Week 8 already and we’ve covered so much. This week we’ve reflected on our projects, our teams and our learning and have taken ownership of where we want to take our development. 

The learning audit has given us the opportunity to consolidate our knowledge ready for the rest of the course. Today’s hackathon will look at applying what you’ve reviewed this week - use this as an opportunity to play with what you’ve been learning and enjoy yourselves!
